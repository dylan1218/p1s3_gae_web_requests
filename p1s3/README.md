# p1s3_gae_web_requests

## Making a Guess

Making a guess of what we need.
 
We need to fine a "handler function" (????)
* Depending on the URL received
* run different functions.
   * Those functions call other microservices like p1s1 (create?) or p1s2 (modify) to do things
   * Write a function that calls those microservices.
   * And the return value of those services...  ?????
